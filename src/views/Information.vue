    <h2> What is Open League Displays? </h2>
    <p>
        Open League Displays is an open source, cross platform application for downloading and
        setting high resolution wallpapers to your desktop. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The whole idea and design came from the Riot Game's League Displays which is an application
        that runs only under Windows and isn't maintained anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was really enjoying Riot's League Displays but I was also getting frustrated over the
        fact that I couldn't set my wallpaper to newly released skins or on my Linux machine.
        So I decided to create this project.
